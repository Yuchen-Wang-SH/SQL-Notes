## Most important commands

- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database

## SELECT

### DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
```

### WHERE

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

#### Operators

Operator Description
= Equal

**<>** Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=

**BETWEEN** Between a certain range

- ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
  ```

**LIKE** Search for a pattern

- % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
- \_ - The underscore represents a single character
- (And more [wildcards](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp).)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Customers
  WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';
  ```

**IN** To specify multiple possible values for a column

- ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
  ```
- ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
  ```

**IS NULL and IS NOT NULL** Not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='MÃ¼nchen');
```

### ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
```

### LIMIT

```sql
-- MySQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
```

```

Or

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

## UPDATE
