# SQL

## What can it do?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

## Most important commands

- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database
- INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
- CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
- ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
- CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
- ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
- DROP TABLE - deletes a table
- CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
- DROP INDEX - deletes an index

## SELECT

### DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
```

### WHERE

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

#### Operators

Operator Description
= Equal

**<>** Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=

**BETWEEN** Between a certain range

- ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
  ```

**LIKE** Search for a pattern

- % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
- \_ - The underscore represents a single character
- (And more [wildcards](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp).)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Customers
  WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';
  ```

**IN** To specify multiple possible values for a column

- ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
  ```
- ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
  ```

**IS NULL and IS NOT NULL** Not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='MÃ¼nchen');
```

### ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
```

### LIMIT

```sql
-- MySQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
```

### Alias

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp

### JOIN

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
```

- (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
- FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table

#### Self JOIN

```sql
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
```

### UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL.

```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```

### GROUP BY / HAVING

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
```

### EXISTS

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_exists.asp

```sql
-- The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE SupplierId = Suppliers.supplierId AND Price < 20);
```

### ANY / ALL

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_any_all.asp

```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
```

### SELECT INTO

The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.

The new table will be created with the column-names and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names using the AS clause.

```sql
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'
FROM Customers;
```

### CASE

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;

SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30"
    ELSE "The quantity is under 30"
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);
```

### Null Functions

```sql
--MySQL
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products
```

## INSERT INTO

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

Or

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

### INSERT INTO SELECT

The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.

- INSERT INTO SELECT requires that data types in source and target tables match
- The existing records in the target table are unaffected

```sql
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany';
```

## UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

## DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## CREATE/DROP

```sql
CREATE DATABASE databasename;
DROP DATABASE databasename;

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

### Constraints

- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
- UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
- PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
- FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
- CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition
- DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
- INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

## ALTER

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
```
